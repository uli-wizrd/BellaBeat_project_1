# BellaBeat and how to help companies play it smart

## Context behind the work

You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused
products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the
global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart
device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of
Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The
insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. 

The previous information was the guide used to create all of the files in this repo.

## The queries

The first file we'll talk about is the SQL querie script I created on MySQL to create and clean all of the tables used in this project, it also serves as a registry of my process in case the code contains mistakes it makes it easier to correct, it contains the SQL commands used and annotations that indicate the purpose of the query. The following is a link to the file that contains the SQL script used to querie the tables in the dataset:
